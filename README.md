# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of the analysis was to determine total weekly fares for each city type Urban, Suburban, and Rural. Our goal is to provide data visualization to stakeholders about how the data differ by geographical locations. This will allow Pyber to promote access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underprivileged neighborhoods.

# Results:
Of the three different city types: Urban, Suburban from January to April all areas saw peaks in usage during what can be assumed as holidays. The urban area showed more peaks over the course of the 4 months, this could be due to local events. For example, St. Patrick's Day, a day Pyber would typically see a substantially surge in fare. There was a spike in the urban sector, barely distinguishable peak in suburban and nonexistent in rural areas showed in Figure 1. It's important to note that the rural areas have far fewer people using ride-sharing services. When comparing urban and suburban cities, the average connection is 2:1, while the same relationship between urban and rural cities is 9:1.

## Summary of Results:
### Percentage of Total Rides for Each City Type<br />
Rural ride was 5.2%<br />
Suburban rides were 26.3%<br />
Urban rides were 68.4%<br />

### Percentage of Total Drivers for Each City Type<br />
Rural ride was 2.6%<br />
Suburban rides were 16.4%<br />
Urban rides were 80.8%<br />

$63,538.64<br />

### Average Fare per Ride<br />
Rural       $34.62 (Average $10.09 more than Urban customers)<br />
Suburban    $30.97 (Average $6.44 more than Urban customers)<br />
Urban       $24.53<br />

### Average Fare per Driver<br />
Rural       $55.49 (Average $38.92 more than Urban drivers)<br />
Suburban    $39.50 (Average $22.93 more than Urban drivers)<br />

Figure 1 indicates this stark difference in total fare in each city type.

## Summary:
There are at least three reasons for these low fares, firstly there are not a lot of drivers willing to drive into rural areas, secondly, customers are unwilling to pay the higher cost for receiving the same service, and lastly there is less access to rural areas provided by map and data servicers making use of wireless services difficult. Based on the results, we recommend Pyber invest in increasing profitability in Rural areas by addressing the three items outlined above.
### Recommendation 1
Firstly, there may be fewer drivers willing to drive into rural areas because they fear not having consistent rides and facing less profit than if they went to a suburban or urban area. To eliminate this fear, Pyber should implement grocery and restaurant delivery services this makes driving in rural areas more profitable and adds practicality for people who typically don't leave their homes much anyways. On top of these additions, providing a gas cards, car leasing discounts, or monitary bonuses in a rural area can be a beneficial move.
### Recommendation 2
Secondly, the price of using a ride-sharing service can be as much as 2.5x more expensive in a rural area, a way to reduce this disparity is to provide ride subscription or flat fee for rides regardless of the distance. This would provide some reassurance to customers that they know how much they will be charged regardless of inflated prices due to a lack of drivers. With comprehensive boundaries and regulations, it could help build favoritism and loyalty in these communities.
### Recommendation 3
Lastly, the less practical change would be to increase access to rural areas provided by map and data service providers. Pyber likely contracts services for their map and data coverage out to a bigger company that focuses on developing these services like Apple Maps and AT&T. To increase access to these rural areas Pyber would have to request special development be made in these areas from these services, which would revolutionize access for these underprivileged areas but would likely come at a high cost.

#### Parting thoughts: Though the rural communities appear to be underserved a more detailed study should be conducted to confirm if there is enough demand in this market segment to justify investing in drivers, customers, or infrastructure or a combination of all.
