# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the analysis was to determine total weekly fares for each city type Urban, Suburban, and Rural. Our goal is to provide data visualization to stakeholders about how the data differ by geographical locations. This will allow Pyber to promote access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underprivileged neighborhoods.

# Results:
Of the three different city types: Urban, Suburban from January to April all saw peaks in usage during what can be assumed as holidays. The urban area shows more peaks over the course of the 4 months, this could be due to local events. St. Patrick's Day a day Pyber would typically see a surge of customers is strongest in the urban, barely distinguishable in suburban and nonexistent in rural areas. It's important to note that the rural areas have far fewer people using ride-sharing services compared to their counterparts. When comparing urban and suburban cities, the average connection is 2:1, while the same relationship between urban and rural cities is 9:1.

Figure 1 indicates this stark difference in drivers per city type.

## Summary:
There are at least three reasons for these low fares, firstly there are not a lot of drivers willing to drive into rural areas, secondly, the price of using a ride-sharing service is much higher than the average, and lastly, there is less access to rural areas provided by maps and internet servicers making comings and goings difficult.
### Recommendation 1
Based on the results, we recommend Pyber invest in increasing profitability in Rural areas by addressing the three reasons outlined above. Firstly, there may be fewer drivers willing to drive into rural areas because they may fear not having consistent rides and facing less profit than if they went to a suburban or urban area. To eliminate this fear, Pyber should implement grocery and restaurant delivery services this makes driving in rural areas more profitable and adds practicality for people who typically don't leave their homes much anyways. On top of these additions, providing a gas card or bonus in a rural area can be a beneficial move.
### Recommendation 2
Secondly, the price of using a ride-sharing service can be as much as 2.5 expensive in a rural area than in an urban area, a way to reduce this disparity is to provide discounted fares for people who live in rural areas by providing a ride subscription or flat fee for rides regardless of the distance. This would provide some reassurance to customers that they know how much they will be charged regardless of inflated prices due to a lack of drivers. With comprehensive boundaries and regulations, it could help build favoritism in these communities.
### Recommendation 3
Lastly, the less practical change would be to increase access to rural areas provided by map and data service providers. Pyber more than likely contracts services for their map and data coverage out to a bigger company that focuses on developing these services. To increase access to these rural areas Pyber would have to request special development be made in these areas from these services, which would revolutionize access for these underprivileged areas but would likely come at a high cost.

### Parting thoughts: Though the rural communities appear to be underserved a more detailed study should be conducted to confirm if there is enough demand in this market segment to justify investing in drivers, customers, or infrastructure.
